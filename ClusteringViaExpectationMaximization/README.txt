Project Name:CSCI 57300 Data Mining
Author: Kaiming Cui



Environment
This project is developed in Python 3.6.1 with 1 library in my mac book
My conda enviroment uses Python 3.7.4 to run my project.
Both version of python work.

Dependency:
1. numpy
2. sys
2. numpy.linalg
3. numpy.matlib
4. scipy.stats 
4. from scipy.stats import multivariate_normal

Important: Please install numpy package and scipy package before running my program. If you use conda environment, run "conda install scipy" and "conda install numpy" before running program. I use scipy.stats to do the multivariate normal pdf calculation

Building and Testing:
1. Upload the zip file to tesla server on local (before login).
    scp Cui-assign3.zip [user_name]@tesla.cs.iupui.edu:/home/[user_name]
    * [user_name] is your username in IUPUI.
2. Login to tesla server with your private password.
    ssh [user_name]@tesla.cs.iupui.edu
3. Archive decompression.
    unzip Cui-assign3.zip
4. Go into the file root “assign2_name”.
    cd Cui-assign3
5. Run the script.
    python FullBayesQ1.py datafile
    python FullBayesQ2.py modelfile datafile
    python NaiveBayesQ1.py datafile
    python NaiveBayesQ2.py modelfile datafile
    python Q3.py

    Q1 will generate a file called 'model.txt' that should be the first parameter into Q2.
    Q1 needs one parameter, it should be 'iris.txt.shuffled'
    Q2 needs two parameters, the first is model file ('model.txt'), the second is datafile ("iris.txt.shuffled")
    Run Q1 before Q2
    Q3 does not need any parameter to run, but it will generate a pdf file called Q3Answers.pdf that contains the output. Q3 use the datafile 'iris.txt.shuffled'

Note:
1. The data file is iris.txt.shuffled
2. The file generated by Q1 is called 'model.txt'
3. The answer of Q3 is stored in the file 'Q3Answers.pdf'
4. Output of Q2 is on your screen.
